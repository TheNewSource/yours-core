This design iterates on the previous mockups and strips back the already minimal design, removing anything that isn't absolutely necessary.

The look also takes a step away from the original Reddit-style boards concept, moving into something that is more unique. It's like a mashup of reddit, twitter and medium. It has the immediacy of new and important information, combined with a chance for deeper ideas and discussion.

Individual boards or subreddits are replaced by tags. When someone makes a new post, they specify which tag it should belong to (i.e. #worldnews, #bitcoin, #technology), then people who are searching or are already following a particular tag will see it. This follows basically the same functionality as the prototype and expands it a bit, and the same could be done for following users later in the future.

This unique, information-focused design could be a great way to differentiate Datt from other apps/services. I think it's in-keeping with the ethos of the platform; no ads or distractions, no spying on users, no censorship, no bullshit.

Some notes on the designs/reasoning:

- The design is simple enough, that once we have all the basic design patterns sorted, it will be easy to quickly add any new features.

- This minimal design is also easily translatable to mobile/tablet, saving dev and design time.

- The simplicity of the design also allows for color schemes (premade by us). I think this is a good idea because:

	- Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, this should appeal to our initial technically minded users who are used to customizing their terminals and coding environments.

	- This could be a significant reason for the initial Datt node to be the first choice for users, since the simple customization it provides means users are less likely to go elsewhere - potentially meaning more income for Datt Inc.

	- Considering the potential benefits, it would be very easy to set up, basically only needing to switch CSS files.

- The overall balance would make an OCD zen monk happy

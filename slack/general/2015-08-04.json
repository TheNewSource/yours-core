Formally, the hierarchy is modelled as a partially ordered set\n(poset), each data item is labelled by a class u in the hierarchy, and is encrypted\nusing the encryption key \u03bau corresponding to that class. Now a user, given access\nto the private information Su, can derive the relevant encryption key \u03bav for any\ndescendant class v, and hence gain access to the data of class v.\nSuch hierarchical key assignment schemes can be used in many applications where\nit is desirable to provide differentiated access to data according to an access control\npolicy. As an illustration, consider the management of a database containing sensitive\ninformation, such as medical records in a hospital; doctors, depending on their\nseniority, are assigned access permission to a set of files in a patient\u2019s medical record,\nwhile nurses, being at a lower level in the hierarchy, have more restricted access to\nthat information. Other application domains include government communication,\nprotection of industrial secrets, and broadcast services such as cable TV.",

Hierarchies could also allow for one direction used for signing keys, another for encryption keys. There are numerous other possibilities with hierarchical keys.",

Ths property can be used for distributed forum moderation: choose a bunch of senior forum members, get a public key from each of them, create a threshold public key from some of the individual public keys, and then let individuals submit a signature when they think a post should be removed. The third-party organizer (probably an automated program) will combine the signatures without leaking whose signature actually contributed towards meeting the threshold.

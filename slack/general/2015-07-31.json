Maybe they could just send it directly to each other, either via Whisper or web standards like WebRTC.\n\nIs this data that multiple people want to access and doesn't need to be modified by a program on the blockchain?

We try to answer that question this week in a discussion of the debate over mandated security backdoors currently raging between media outlets and technologists. We also discuss the role of historical revisionism and examples of how a decentralist critique can add to our understanding of the role of power and freedom in the past. Our guest this week is Steve Dekorte, creator of decentralized marketplace [BitMarkets][bitmarkets] and lead developer at [<http:\/\/Voluntary.net|Voluntary.net>][<http:\/\/voluntary.net|voluntary.net>]. We discuss the challenges and promises of uncensored trade, the proper place of anonymity and identity, and the philosophy driving the work of the <http:\/\/Voluntary.net|Voluntary.net> team.

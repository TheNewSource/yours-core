Don\u2019t like what a particular political candidate has to say? Downvote it. After all, there isn\u2019t any cost to do so. Additionally, it\u2019s somewhat easy to create \u201cbots\u201d that will automatically upvote or downvote content.\n\nAs a result, people can severely limit and\/or manipulate what is seen by others without any cost to themselves. It can also negatively impact a content provider\u2019s reputation. We think that\u2019s a problem. Although we agree all content does not offer the same value, we want to discourage activities like \u201cdownvote brigades\u201d that you see so often at places like reddit.\n\nWhen you downvote content, it costs you two karma and the author one karma (1 karma = USD $0.01). As there is a cost, we expect this to significantly reduce behaviors like downvote brigades. We\u2019re all for voicing your negative opinion on something, and that\u2019s how downvotes are intended. But, as your actions cause the author to lose something of value (e.g. karma, reputation), we want you to feel strongly enough about it. In other words, we require you to put your money where your mouth is \u2013 and where your values are. If you\u2019re not willing to do that, it must not be that important to you. Best then to just leave the other person alone and go your separate way.\"",

(to see how it works, click the \"show\" link on any valME post between the voting arrows.) so, for example, posts in a community could have moderator-defined votes for \"intelligent,\" \"agree\", \"funny,\" etc. this way, a community is able to express more specifically the kind of value they received (or didn't) from content (or the kinds of values for which the community is based and expectations about contributions). this then serves a useful purpose of being able to rank, for example, the communities with \"more intelligent\" content from the community with \"funnier\" content from the community with the \"least intelligent\" content. it also allows you to do the same regarding users (e.g., who is submitting the most intelligent content). doing this also allows users (i.e., the market) to express their dissatisfaction with certain communities (e.g., \/r\/fatpeoplehate) by putting their money where their mouths are. in theory, you could even then cause the submission price of a community to automatically go up as the downvotes increased or down as the upvotes increased, thus making it more costly for communities that don't add value to participate or less costly for communities that do. multiple customized karma types also allows for community efforts to do things like commit to a project (<http:\/\/valme.io\/c\/gettingstarted\/faq\/cqqqs\/whats-a-project>):\n\n\"We\u2019ve provided functionality allowing you to submit a \u201cproject\u201d post, which gives you two capabilities: an additional karma type called \u201ccommit\u201d and a way to send messages to everyone who commits.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re really upset about the NSA destroying people\u2019s civil liberties, and you want to organize a protest march in front of their offices. (Although finding their offices may be problematic, considering how secretive they are. But we digress...) You can submit a post titled \u201cStare down the NSA! Come join our protest against these fiends!\u201d Checking the project box will put [PROJECT] in the title. Additionally, when members vote, they will see the karma type commit. By upvoting commit, they are indicating their plans to participate in the cause. The post author can then click on a link within the post to message all members who committed to the project. This allows the author to communicate directly with only participating members.\"",

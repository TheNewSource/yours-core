                "text": "Huemerian Anarchist Libertarianism Huemerian anarchist libertarianism\u00a0is\u00a0the political position that the vast majority of\u00a0people (due to having roughly\u00a0liberal values) would arrive at\u00a0if they became convinced of the two main theses of\u00a0Professor Michael Huemer\u2019s book The Problem of Political Authority: An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Duty to Obey: No government (nor any other person or group) genuinely possesses the special moral property called political authority. Establishing or keeping governments\u00a0is not highly likely to result in\u00a0a much better society\u00a0than all\u00a0other possible\u00a0courses of action. Very few people currently accept either of these theses. Acceptance of the first thesis leads a typical person with roughly liberal values to minarchist libertarianism. The\u00a0term\u00a0Huemerian minarchist libertarianism\u00a0can be used to describe anyone\u00a0who came to be a minarchist libertarian\u00a0because they accepted\u00a0Huemer\u2019s\u00a0first thesis that governments lack political authority. Acceptance of the\u00a0second thesis as well leads one to anarchist libertarianism. A Huemerian anarchist libertarian is someone who is a libertarian anarchist\u00a0because they\u2014unlike the Huemerian minarchists\u2013have accepted the second thesis and thus no longer see governments as being justified on consequentialist grounds. Acceptance of these two theses in this order is what brought me to anarchist libertarianism. I know I\u2019m not unique in this regard: Many libertarian anarchists (also called\u00a0anarcho-capitalists or\u00a0free market anarchists) have followed a similar intellectual path. My Intellectual Journey to\u00a0Anarchist Libertarianism In 2010, before Michael Huemer had written The Problem of Political Authority, a libertarian anarchist friend of mine challenged my unconscious assumption that it was okay for governments to engage in a wide range of activities prohibited to all other persons and organizations. He pointed out that if anyone else acted like the government\u2014such as\u00a0by taxing people or commanding them to not\u00a0engage in\u00a0certain peaceful activities and then imprisoning them\u00a0for disobeying\u2014I would believe they were guilty of extortion, kidnapping, and so on. Most government\u00a0activity suddenly seemed criminal in nature. I suddenly felt a strong need to find a\u00a0good explanation\u00a0for why\u00a0governments should be permitted\u00a0to act\u00a0in this manner. It didn\u2019t occur to me that maybe they shouldn\u2019t be permitted to act in these ways until after I spent many hours considering\u00a0hundreds of arguments for why they should be able to and failed\u00a0to come up with\u00a0anything satisfactory. I suppose I have\u00a0status quo bias to thank for this. I didn\u2019t question the status quo. My friend questioned it for me and I made every effort to defend it.\u00a0I was a reluctant Huemerian minarchist libertarian. Even after I acknowledged that governments shouldn\u2019t be granted a special moral status above everyone else, I still didn\u2019t begin to question the status quo. Instead, I maintained that small, minimal governments were necessary to\u00a0address\u00a0certain essential societal problems. I then entered the six-month phase. Joke:\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a minarchist and an anarchist? \u2026Six months.\u201d In my case it took\u00a0approximately\u00a0seven months. If I was reluctant to accept the first\u00a0view that\u00a0there is no good reason to believe that governments have the special moral authority that people treat them as having (and thus was reluctant to become a minarchist), I was even more reluctant to accept the second view that governments weren\u2019t necessary to provide essential services and thus\u00a0couldn\u2019t be justified on\u00a0consequentialist grounds (and thus was even more reluctant to become an anarchist). I remember the moment clearly, sitting in my dorm room my freshman year of college in January 2011. I was sitting at my desk, re-reading some long debates\u00a0I had had with my anarchist friend about the workings of a society without a state, realizing that I had been wrong about so many things\u2014so many services addressing important problems\u00a0could be provided in a voluntary fashion, as he had argued. It wasn\u2019t necessary to have a government to threaten and bully\u00a0people in an effort to solve the\u00a0problems like I had assumed. Eventually I had to acknowledge that a society without a state would not be a violent, chaotic, nightmarish, Hobbesian\u00a0world after all. While I now agree that \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere close to the case where government would be justified\u201c\u2014(meaning the expected result of replacing government with a polycentric legal system of competing providers of security and dispute resolution services is much better than would be necessary for it to be justified for people to act as agents of government or otherwise support their existence)\u2014at the time I still thought that anarcho-capitalist societies might produce\u00a0mediocre results. Still, despite society without government possibly being mediocre, I knew that it would not be so bad as to justify the existence of political-authority-less governments. Therefore, despite my ingrained desire to continue believing that having a government was a good thing, I reluctantly\u00a0admitted that even a minimal state is\u00a0not justified. \u201cGuess what\u2026 I\u2019m an anarchist,\u201d I said to my roommate\u00a0in surprise and disbelief the moment I admitted it to myself. \u201cWhaaat,\u201d he said, thinking I was crazy. I had thought it was crazy too and never expected it to happen. Me? An Anarchist? Yeah, right. But I no longer think it\u2019s crazy.\u00a0Polycentric Law, a.k.a. Anarcho-Capitalism [is]\u00a0No Big Deal. I agree with Michael Strong that \u201cwe need to get people to realize that polycentric law, or anarcho-capitalism, is just no big deal and we should get over it already.\u201d It\u2019s very important that we help others understand this. Anarchist Libertarianism is Not Extremist The above story of my intellectual journey to libertarian anarchism (the same journey that\u00a0Michael Huemer attempts to create for his reader)\u00a0is more a story about psychological biases and barriers than it is a story about\u00a0anything else. Libertarianism is not extremist. Anarchism is not extremist. I hold the same values as I did five years ago before I had taken\u00a0any time\u00a0to think\u00a0about politics or political philosophy. I more or less hold the same values as my friends and family. Libertarian anarchists don\u2019t have significantly different values than most other people; they\u2019ve just realized that popular political views and the current structure of societies aren\u2019t consistent with those values. Nobody should see libertarian anarchism\u00a0as being extremist. The reality is that it\u2019s\u00a0common sense.",

It is insane that we do not have a standard yet. \n\nAt Tradle we have spent a huge amount of time designing p2p protocol associated with the blockchain and producing the associated OSS code. The basic ideas are:\n\n-  all actions are associated with the identity of your choice. Identity can be totally fake or verified by the government (as required on airbnb for example). You can create as many of them as u like and all identities, their keys and key restore\/revocation as anchored on blockchain, so the chain is your key server.\n- p2p messages can be ephemeral or permanent. Permanent can be anchored to the public blockchain and not (anchored to local\/federated chains, but for now we just use simpler logs)\n- p2p  messages have open ended structure (json for now) and types of messages (models) are loaded from github or other web sites freely. These msgs can be new community, new post, upvote\/downvote, moderator actions, etc. or could be verification of identity or any other stuff needed for the web of trust (or as <http:\/\/keybase.io|keybase.io> calls them - tracked identities)\n- discovery of peers and topic should be 100% decentralized (we use a combination of identities on chain for finding verified pub keys and the bittorrent DHT for finding IP\/Port of peers.\n- peer discovery leads to a NAT traversal and UDP-based rUDP or uTP for reliable delivery of jsons over this line. Could support webrtc too of course, but does not yet.",

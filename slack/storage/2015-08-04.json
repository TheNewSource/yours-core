It would be the same as the moderation lists discussed elsewhere, except presumably double-hashed to avoid people using the ban list as a directory. I\u2019m not sure who you would trust to moderate illegal content though: moderating something implies that you had access to it at some point, since filtering just by the metadata would be simple to work around for determined individuals. Anonymity might be required to protect the moderator from legal repercussions, despite their intent.",

Considering there is CP in the bitcoin blockchain I\u2019m not that concerned that LE will be diving into heavily obfuscated data stores to find this stuff unless it becomes a big problem. At that point maybe one of these solutions will have come to be and you can do some optional filtering. I think you\u2019re sending yourself down a rat hole if you try to do it yourself.",

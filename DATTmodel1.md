@bradkam's DATT business model
=======================

## Premise
A Reddit like application where users pay a predefined amount directly to creators when they vote on content.

- User: Votes on posts and comments. Pays the content creator.
- Creator: Create Posts and Comments. Gets paid by Users and pays Mods.
- Mod - Controller of the channel. Gets paid by Creators and pays Nodes.
- Node - Gets paid by Mods. Pays Datt.
- DATT - Gets paid by Nodes. Builds protocol.


### Money/Value flow
1. Users pay a predefined amount to vote on a post and another predefined amount to vote on a comment
2. Creators receive the majority of the money from users, but pay mods a fee
3. Mods curate/moderate and receive a % of fees paid to creators in exchange for that service
4. The amount that creators receive for votes on posts and comments is defined by the mod
5. Users upvote/downvote the % fee the Mod should take
6. The % fee that the Node takes is determined by the mods
7. The % fee that Datt takes is determined by the Nodes
8. Nodes that display content hosted by other Nodes give 100% of fees to the hosting Node
9. Any Node can choose to share or block any other node
10. All fees made by the content creator are displayed within the post
11. All fees made by the Mod are displayed at the top of their channel

### Why is this better than the current system at Reddit?

 - Mods are financially motivated to increase the # of votes. They will focus on content curation.
 - Content creators have an incentive to post content here instead of on traditional media platforms where they only receive ad revenue.
 - Nodes are financially motivated to provide Mod friendly policies around censorship, create better tools for Mods to curate, and provide good user experiences.
 - Legal liability arising from receiving a % necessitates removing copy written content and ensuring that the right people are paid.
 - Legal liability arising from receiving a % necessitates removing criminal content.


**To be determined:**

 - where do down votes on posts pay out? (do we need down votes?)

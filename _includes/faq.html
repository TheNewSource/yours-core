                            It's important that content published to Datt can be distributed widely and freely without a central organization having control. While it would be easier to centralize or federate content between servers, this would not achieve our goals.

                            No. The basic Datt client will run as a web app in your browser. We expect mobile apps and advanced clients will be developed at a later stage.

                            Users can apply their own content filters, or subscribe to collectives where moderators have curated content. Users can select as little or as many collectives to filter the content you most want to see.

                            We've worked out a model that benefits everyone who participates on the network - Authors, Moderators, Node Operators, and Commenters can all benefit from Bitcoin micropayments. We'll announce more on this soon.

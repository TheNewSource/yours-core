## Log

During the very early stages of Datt, a log of events was kept here, in the
"log" section of the dattdocs README. The log has since been moved to the blog
at [blog.datt.co](http://blog.datt.co). The GitHub repository for the blog is
at [github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog).
Since the log has been linked externally to this section on the repo on GitHub,
we retain this section here so as to not break the external links.

Datt Documentation
==================
Datt is a community, business, product and technology. The dattdocs repo is to
store documentation on all of these aspects of Datt.

For a basic outline of the project, see the
[plan](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/blob/master/plan.md).

## Log

During the very early stages of Datt, a log of events was kept here. The log
has since been moved to the blog at  [blog.datt.co](http://blog.datt.co). The
GitHub repository for the blog is at
[github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog).
Since the log has been linked externally to this section on the the repo on
GitHub, we retain this section here so as to not break the external links.

Datt Documentation
==================
Datt is a community, business, product and technology. The dattdocs repo is to
store documentation on all of these aspects of Datt.

- For a basic outline of the project, see
  [general/plan.md](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/blob/master/general/plan.md).
- For an updated list of relevant links and resources outside of Datt, see
  [general/links.md](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/blob/master/general/links.md).

## Log

During the very early stages of Datt, a log of events was kept here, in the
"log" section of the dattdocs README. The log has since been moved to the blog
at [blog.datt.co](http://blog.datt.co). The GitHub repository for the blog is
at [github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog).
Since the log has been linked externally to this section on the repo on GitHub,
we retain this section here so as to not break the external links.

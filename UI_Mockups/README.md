Check out the "READ FIRST - Workflows" folder to understand how specific UX features and site functions work. These images in this folder include references which will tell you where to find specific files.

If you want to get exact measurements, elements, fonts, colors etc, you can use the source photoshop file located at Image_Mockups/PSD Source File/

Remember, these are just ideas. They need a lot of work to polish them up and make them consistent, but it should be enough to get an idea.

GENERAL DESIGN NOTES:

The goal here was to take the overall feeling of a Reddit/Forum type design, simplify it, and make it more applicable to a P2P site. I wanted to put a unique spin on it, and make a bold statement with the minimalism. This in turn helps focus the user squarely on the content, and nothing else.

Here are some general notes and reasoning behind my design choices:

- Points are replaced by dots. This is for a couple of reasons:
	- If each like/upvote actually equated to real money, and everyone could figure the amounts out, this might make people targets for all sorts of annoying behavior.
	- The dots are way simpler aesthetically.
	- If the psychological aspect of points is removed, and no-one knows exactly what the point number is, this may get rid of karma whoring.

- The colorscheme of the main site is intentionally limited (as shown in Image_Mockups/standard/)
	- Admins can still customize the colors of the boards they run to add their own style. (only custom colors, not css/images)
	- There could be a "lights out" night theme. (various people have requested this)
	- Users should be able to override the different colors and have the simple monotone theme site-wide.

- Similar to reddit, the sidebar will show relevant content/rules for each board.

- The search and new post/new board are located in the top right of the page and accessible at all times.
	- If the user is already inside a board (i.e. /Funny/), their search will automatically be localized. Same with new posts.

LOGO NOTES:

The logo is as simple as it gets, while still conveying the important points. It's intended to be used as a symbol by itself, like how Apple often only uses the apple symbol. 

- The dots represent the decentralized nature of the site
- The arrangement/size of the dots are intended to mirror the sites function, i.e. the best content rises. Check out the animated gifs in the /Logo/ folder to see what I mean.
- The dot theme is consistent with the dot "like" function on the site.

I think there's a boldness in the simplicity, and it would be very versatile for other branding purposes.

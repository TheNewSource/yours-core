In just two days of invites, we've managed to gather 59 people to join the
Slack channel!

Priorities:

- Establish minimal product plan, including mockups (subject to change, of
  course, depending on technical choices and UI decisions - the goal is to just
  come up with something minimal that provides a good direction for the UI).

- Research technologies, and establish basic technologies for a prototype
  (technologies are subject to change - there are a lot to choose from, and we
  haven't had time to research them all yet).

- Establish basic business plan. Although the network is decentralized, there
  are still lots ways to earn money, because each node can accept payments. The
  business plan doesn't have to be final, but rather more of an example of the
  way a business might be able to earn money from running a node.

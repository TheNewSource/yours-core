My television education from childhood informs me that whenever you do
something big, you need a Master Plan. Over the past couple of weeks I've come
to realize that is exactly what we need for Datt. When we starting working on
Datt at the [first hackathon](/articles/2015-07-31-hackathon-day-one/), we
brought a lot of people together who liked the idea of a "decentralized
reddit", but we didn't have any detailed plans. At that hackathon and over time
since then, we've produced a lot of documents (most of which are available on
[dattdocs](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs)) covering our business
plans, community plans, product plans and technology plans, but some of them
were mutually incompatible and there was no coherent unified vision of all of
them. So I've now merged our plans into one giant (incomplete, alpha, but
logically consistent) [Master Plan for
Datt](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/blob/master/plan.md).

Ultimately, the master plan should be an overview of the entire project that
pretty much everyone working on the project should agree with. It will be most
useful for educating prospective collaborators about what we are building and
helping to guide them in choosing what to work on. It should also be a
collaborative document in the sense that I shouldn't be the only person writing
it - so please either push minor changes or issue pull requests for major
changes.

Note that the master plan is not complete and is intended to evolve with time.
I have not yet included all content produced by contributors into the master
plan. Key information is missing from each section. This does not mean I
disagree with any of the material produced by others, but rather I hadn't
gotten around to adding it in a coherent way to this document.

After other people have had some time to review it and hopefully update the
various components, it will eventually reach a 1.0 state, and at the point,
though it should continue to change, it should not change in any fundamental
way. Today, it is early enough yet that it may change fundamentally before we
launch.

Other status updates:
* Chris pushed some new mockups to
[dattmedia](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattmedia).
* Over the past two weeks I pushed some minor changes to
[datt-node](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt-node), however we still do
not have a timeline for a prototype.
* We're doing another mini-hackathon tomorrow in San Francisco at the Starbucks
on Townsend.
* I went to the [Scaling Bitcoin workshop in
Montreal](/articles/2015-09-15-scaling-bitcoin/).

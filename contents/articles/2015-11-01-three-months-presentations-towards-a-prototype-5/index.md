It's been three months and one day since the hackathon that kickstarted Datt
([1](http://www.meetup.com/blockchainU/events/224266192/),
[2](/articles/2015-07-31-hackathon-day-one/),
[3](/articles/2015-08-02-hackathon-day-three/)). A lot has happened during that
time, most significantly a huge amount of intellectual work designing and
planning what we are building on
[dattdocs](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs) and
[dattmedia](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattmedia), and a half-working
prototype on [datt](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt).

There was a three week period of time where I obsessively focused only on
programming the prototype and was extremely productive
([1](/articles/2015-09-27-towards-a-prototype/),
[2](/articles/2015-10-05-towards-a-prototype-2/),
[3](/articles/2015-10-14-yc-and-towards-a-prototype-3/)). I'm going to do
another three week sprint with the intent of finishing the prototype. This will
last from Nov. 3 - Nov. 23. My plan is to basically stop working on all aspects
of Datt other than the prototype, and I will be pretty uncommunicative during
that time. So if I don't respond to your emails or post any updates to the
blog, Twitter, or Slack, it's because I'm programming. :)

Last week I gave four presentations at Blockchain University and one at the
[San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup on
Datt](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Bitcoin-Social/events/223421691/). My
Blockchain University slides are [on my blockchain-university
repo](https://github.com/ryanxcharles/blockchain-university/tree/master/slides),
and my Datt slides are [on
dattdocs](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/tree/master/archive). I will
be giving two more presentations on Datt tomorrow which will show up on
dattdocs. After that, the sprint begins.

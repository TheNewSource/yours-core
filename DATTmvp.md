## MVP
**It must be possible to:**

 - Post markdown formatted body text with a title | Post a link with a title
 - Distribute post content between peers
 - Sort content for display (chronological, total views, active peers, tips:peer ratio, average comment karma)
 - Comment on posts and have the comments also distribute to peers
 - Tag or Categorize posts
 - Allow for peers to participate as Moderators listing the content that they have curated
 - Create a BIP39 address for the user

**It is desirable to be able to:**

 - Monetarily incentivize contributors (Content creators)
 - Optionally include a Title image
 - Crawl link posts to pull a thumbnail image from the source content
 - Display only comments above a defined karma threshold
 - Allow nested comment threads
 - Throttle content submissions to reduce spam
 - Allow users to withdraw funds (CoinJoin?)
 - Derive BIP32/BIP44 addresses
 - Multi-sig addresses between devices the user controls | Multi-sig addresses where a 3rd party controls an address
 - Identity management using signed messages | Keybase.io or other integration for identity

**It is not necessary to:**

 - Allow editing of the body text or title after publishing
 - Decentralize Facebook | Slack | [insert other social/collaboration platform]
 - Integrate directly with existing Bitcoin wallets

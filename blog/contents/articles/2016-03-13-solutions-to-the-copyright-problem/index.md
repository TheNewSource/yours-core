One of the questions I get asked most frequently about Datt is, "how are you
going to prevent people from posting other people's content, and thus getting
paid for content they didn't create?" First of all, note that this problem is not
unique to Datt. This is the same copyright problem that book publishers
addressed (but never fully solved) a long time ago by [encouraging
governments to create copyright
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyright_law).

It's interesting to note that the fact that so many people detect that
copyright is still a problem indicates that copyright law never actually solved
the problem. It is the case today that people will often resell books, movies,
or other forms of intellectual property as if they created them, and not give
any proceeds to the the actual author. Datt will create a market for
information, where people can post their own content and get paid for it. This
will invite fraud the same way any market invites fraud - some people will try
to scam others by posting information they didn't create.

Not only might some people most content they didn't create, but the worst case
scenario is that the people buying information actually want this. That is that
Datt unwittingly turns into a market specifically for and focused on
incorrectly attributed content. For instance, what if people primarily post
Hollywood movies, when they themselves did not play any role in creating those
movies? And worse, what if the users of Datt specifically want to pay these
people, without giving any money to the actual creators, because they are able
to watch the movies more conveniently via Datt?

First of all, technically, copyright law still applies. If someone uses Datt to
sell information belonging to someone else, that is illegal. However, I don't
think the government will help us, because they have no incentive to help, and
would probably to try to shut Datt down rather than contribute meaningfully to
a solution. Thus, it will be important for Datt to integrate technical or
social solutions to the copyright problem that don't rely on government. Here
are some ways Datt can combat the copyright problem:

- Allow users to flag content as incorrectly attributed. This is a
  human-powered solution to identity probable copyright violations. If you
  noticed someone is posting something they didn't create and passing it off as
  their own, flag that content as "incorrectly attributed" or "copyright
  violation".
- Develop, purchase or otherwise leverage automated content flagging systems,
  like those used by Youtube and Soundcloud. Both Youtube and Soundcloud have
  systems that scan audio and video and pattern match against known copyrighted
  content, such as MPAA movies or RIAA music. Although running such software is
  computationally expensive, Datt, Inc. can offer this service to the community
  to flag probable stolen content, and the default client can be set to hide
  probable stolen content.
- Enable escrow for payments until content is known to be original or is
  unlikely to be fraudulent. Although when p2p payments are involved it is not
  possible to force anybody to use escrow, it is still possible to enable
  escrow to people who wish to use it. Payments could either be escrowed
  through Datt, Inc. or through a market of escrow providers, who delay payouts
  until the probability that content is original increases highly enough. For
  instance, if a user validates their Datt keypair against a Facebook profile,
  Twitter profile, LinkedIn profile and email address, and they have a long
  history on all of these profiles, then they are probably a real person who
  doesn't want to risk their reputation, and thus the escrow can make payments
  to them rapidly. If someone does not validate their account in any way, then
  payouts to them can be delayed until other users have a chance to flag their
  content as copyrighted or not. If it turns out that content is incorrectly
  attributed, then payments to not go to the poster at all, but are reversed
  and sent back to the payers.
- Curate a culture of respecting copyright. One of the goals of Datt is to
  reward original content producers. The goal absolutely is not to reward
  people for presenting someone else's content as their own. By making this a
  clear cultural principle at every step by encouraging original content and
  discouraging incorrectly attributed content in the language of the
  application and in the actions of the core users, we can facilitate the type
  of culture we want to see using Datt.
- Long-term, leverage blockchain technology to track content ownership. If,
  ultimately, a global system of tracking ownership of content were created,
  the problem could be solved globally and would not require any custom
  solutions in Datt.

Datt will not be the first marketplace to have to deal with the copyright
problem, but we can employ technical and social means to make it more difficult
or costly to post incorrectly attributed content. Copyright law, unfortunately,
will not help much at all. Instead, the solutions are, 1) Human flagging, 2)
Automated flagging, 3) Payment escrow, 4) Curating a culture of original
content creation, and 5) Long-term adopting a global blockchain-based solution.
We will also be able to iterate on solutions over time depending on exactly how
big of a problem this is.

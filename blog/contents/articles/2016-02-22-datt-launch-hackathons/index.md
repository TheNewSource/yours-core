A few weeks ago I decided to set up the Second Great Decentralize All The
Things Global Hackathon for the weekend of Februrary 26 - 28, 2016. It turns
out that this is the same weekend as the [LAUNCH
Hackathon](http://www.launchhackathon.com/). Rather than reschedule, it seemed
cool to simply merge the two hackathons. I will be at LAUNCH working on Datt,
and anyone else in the Bay Area is invited to join the hackathon and work on
Datt at the LAUNCH venue. Meanwhile, we will have a global online portion of
the hackathon to take place in our Slack channel (sign up using the link at the
bottom of [datt.co](http://datt.co/)). I may or may not try to actually win the
LAUNCH hackathon - I will decide this week. Either way, it seems like a good
way to meet like-minded people and make some progress on Datt.

So here's a rough outline of the plan:
- This weekend I will be collaborating with Paul Salisbury and Steven McKie to
  sketch out the logistics of how the hackathon will work.
- We will be putting up a hackathon page at datt.co/hackathon .
- There will be some videos and tweets from the physical location.
- I will be emailing the Datt mailing list for the first time ever to inform
  them about the hackathon.

Some possible goals for the hackathon (details to be worked out):
- Research ipfs and web torrent as options for the Datt p2p protocol.
- Work on the issues on the GitHub page that iterate us towards MVP.
- Describe alternative products that can be based on the Datt backend (a
  "decentralized reddit" is only one of countless possible ways to use the datt
  backend for a blockchain-based social media application - perhaps others will
  be more popular).
- Prize for submitting the best PR? Or best 3 PRs?
- Try to win the hackathon?

I will post another blog post this week about the hackathon once more details
are known.

Other things:

- Willy has contributed a bunch of code integrating Chris' work on the UI into
  the front-end, so we have a much better UI now :)
- Chris made a really great video about Datt: [Datt: The next step in social
  networks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjMIeio_qfY)
- I've spent some time improving fullnode with an emphasis on making it easier
  to put blocking cryptography into workers more easily. This work hasn't yet
  found its way into Datt yet, but will soon.
- I wrote an article comparing [Thailand, Panama and San
  Francisco](https://ryanxcharlestimes.com/thailand-vs-panama-vs-san-francisco-b4b47d5ca49b)
  as place for starting a company. One reason not to be in San Francisco is
  because it is extremely expensive. Since then, I've ended up moving to
  Oakland because I found a place that is much less expensive than my apartment
  in San Francisco.  So for the time being, I will not be leaving the Bay Area.
  However, Panama remains my top choice for my first hop to internationalize
  myself, and would also be an easier place to run the Datt business with
  respect to banking, so it is still possible I will move there to continue
  working on Datt.
- In that same article, I mentioned dismantling "Datt, Inc.". I have to retract
  that decision. I still need a Delaware C corp for various reasons, including
  legal liability and having a business bank account, so I am going to keep
  that one. It doesn't matter that it is called "Datt, Inc." - it is still
  separate from the open-source project Datt.

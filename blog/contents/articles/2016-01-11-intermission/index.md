I'm bearish on the United States Government. One of the greatest assets of the
US is the dollar, and I think the blockchain revolution will ultimately remove
the dollar from its position as the de facto world reserve currency. The best
case scenario for the US is that the dollar remains used inside its borders at
a reduced value, similar to other fiat currencies, and is not widely used
outside the US. The worst case scenario is that the dollar hyperinflates to
zero value.  Whatever the outcome, the dollar losing its stature will be bad
for the US. As such, I am considering what options I have personally to hedge
outside of US territory so that I am not personally harmed by a financial
catastrophe there.

I'm writing this article from Delhi, India where I am considering opportunities
here to internationalize myself. Previously I was in Hyderabad, Bangkok, and
Tokyo, and next I will be visiting Panama, all while making connections and
plotting ways to partner with people in these places. My trip is partially
funded by Blockchain University, and the proximate cause for my trip is to
teach blockchain at financial institutions in Japan and India. The ultimate
cause, however, is that I am planning my exit from the US, and the education I
am gaining on this trip is invaluable to help me figure out how (this is the
first time I've ever circumnavigated the planet).

Datt, Inc. is a Delaware C corp and will remain that way. However, I don't
think legal corporations are the future of human organization. Legal
corporations are a pre-cryptography technology enforced by threats of violence
(e.g., someone who commits fraud will be imprisoned). I believe the future of
human organization will leverage cryptography to lower costs, increase trust
and increase flexibility to organize human activity. Creating a legal
corporation will ultimately be seen as an inefficient and insecure tool for
organizations.  As such, while Datt works just fine for now as a Delaware C
corp, my not all of my future activity will fall under the "Datt" label.
Non-Datt activity will fall under corporations in other countries or
cryptocorporations.

  more intensive search for cofounders and will investigate a more formal
  relationship with IDEO.

We have a landing page now: http://datt.co

Ryan Shea points out this excellent, related post from /r/bitcoin: [Meta on
hardforking - mods censors a post about Bitcoin
XT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3gdad5/meta_on_hardforking_if_bitcoin_is_so_vulnerable/)

Also, I wanted to highlight some great comments made by Brad Kam about
incentivizing upvotes/downvotes, and how favorite upvotes-only incentivizes
hyped content at the expense of mods:

> Upvote only systems have a tendency toward hype behavior because you can’t
distinguish between disinterested users (those that wouldn’t vote at all) and
those that dislike the content. Bad content can get pushed to the top with a
coordinated effort of upvoting right when the post is created.  It would take a
long time for that content to go to the bottom where it belongs. Hacker News
tries to address this by making content rank depend heavily on time posted (and
we still game it).  YC’s goal is to promote particular content, not to moderate
optimally. Datt's filter could also favor time, but I don't know if that's an
optimal user experience.

> A hypeable system within Datt would strengthen content creators at the
expense of Mods (it’s harder to moderate when content creators make a lot of
money by gaming the system). The popular channels would likely be controlled by
content creators who are also Mods (like Youtube). When you empower content
creators, they no longer want to strengthen the commenters. They likely prefer
a system where each post has a price per click instead of per vote. You could
then vote for free and get access to a slack style channel about that
particular content.  If you restrict commenting (or even viewing comments) to
those who have paid for the content, you can drive purchases.

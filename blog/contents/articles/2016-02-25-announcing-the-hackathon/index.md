We're holding the second Datt hackathon this weekend, Feb. 26 - 28, 2016, on
the Datt Slack channel and in real life at the LAUNCH Hackathon in San
Francisco. The follow text was sent out to the Datt mailing list this morning:

-------------------

Datt is the “decentralized Reddit” project founded by Reddit’s former
Cryptocurrency Engineer, Ryan X. Charles. Datt will feel familiar to Reddit,
but it will be decentralized and integrated with bitcoin micropayments to
incentivize users to post great content. [Watch this great video by Datt
contributor Chris Robinson for an
overview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjMIeio_qfY)

We launched the prototype in December, and now we’re holding the second great
“Decentralize All The Things Global Hackathon” this weekend on our Slack
channel. The event will go from Feb. 26 - Feb. 28, starting at 2pm PT Friday.
This is an open event for anyone interested in the future of content
monetization -- all are welcome. To join us for the event, simply [sign up for
our Slack channel here](http://datt-slackin.herokuapp.com/), and be online
during the hackathon. Some of us located in the San Francisco Bay Area will
also be at the LAUNCH Hackathon during this time. You can sign up for that at
[launchhackathon.com](http://www.launchhackathon.com/).

If you plan to attend the hackathon, either online or in-person, we would
appreciate it if you’d
[RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1w0Yi-VToqxkUixfCC7uxqB7d7c_RurpeagtuABrYmEU/viewform),
and tell us a little about why you are interested in this project.

The primary goal of this hackathon is to identify a more sound direction for
our p2p protocol. To be up to speed on what has happened in the past seven
months since our first hackathon, and what you can do to help, please see these
blog posts:

Not a coder? Are you an enthusiastic entrepreneur or designer?  We’d still love
to hear from you during the hackathon! Attend, and come to help shape how the
community aspects of Datt will evolve in the “#community” channel on Slack.

Can’t wait to hack together!

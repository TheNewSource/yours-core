It's now been over two weeks since we started actually working on Datt. The most
most major advances over the past week are:

1) We have some actual p2p code with working examples in a browser in the
[datt-node repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt-node), thank you very much
Willy and Johan! There are also some informative UML documents in
[dattdocs](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/tree/master/UML).

2) We now have a [landing page](http://datt.co), thank you Chris, Darren, Omar
and Paul! (I hope I'm not forgetting anyone who contributed).

3) We have further UI work laying out what the product should look like, such
as search, what the bitcoin balances should look like, and commenting. Thank
you, Chris! This work is in the [dattmedia
repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattmedia/tree/master/UI_Mockups).

This is the third weekend in a row we have a weekend host so the people in SF
can work together at a physical location. This time ChangeTip is hosting us at
their office in Hayes Valley. Thank you, ChangeTip!

At ZapChain's request, [I was featured on their decentralization
summit](https://www.zapchain.com/a/W7M8nphtCU) which got a little bit of
attention for Datt. I am deliberately not trying to advertise Datt at this
stage, as I think more attention would probably add more noise than signal.
However, when someone asks, I'm usually willing to do an interview or an AMA,
as was the case here.

I've started the process of talking with each of the contributors to figure out
what role they might like to play in the company. If I haven't reached out to
you yet, don't worry, I will within the next couple of weeks. If you would
rather talk sooner rather than later, please let me know and we can schedule a
call sooner.

Datt, and the idea of decentralized content sharing that rewards the users on the network is an idea too big for just one use case. That’s why, we are honing and sharpening the potential for Datt by first creating a system that empowers you to monetize content, from anywhere. Together, we’re making your content, Yours:

-------------------

                                                         

The internet, it was on the most significant advents in human history. Thanks to the power of the “interwebs”, for the first time we (humanity) had finally been gifted a medium to truly call our own; with the ability to communicate in realtime with some of the brightest minds all over the world.

The passage of human knowledge from one to the other is the most essential aspect of human advancement. Thanks to our ability to record and share knowledge for others to see and experience, our lives on this pale blue dot are vastly improved.

But, the exchange of human knowledge is evolving at such a rapid pace. So much data and knowledge is at our fingertips(so much so, theres a word for it, ‘Google’), that sometimes it’s difficult to distill the worthwhile content on the web, when it’s overshadowed by so much ‘noise’. 

That noise has a lot of names: censorship, governmental interference, and spam just to name a few obstacles… The worlds best content is getting buried. Sites have come along to attempt to “dig” up the good stuff (Digg, Reddit, Twitter, etc), and haven’t approached content the way it should have(nor can they ensure its integrity and protection from state censorship). 

Unveiling great content (regardless the medium) is the core of our ethos. But, so is making sure you get paid for your contributions and gain the audience you need to succeed.

At Yours, we believe you should be able to impart your creations and knowledge on the world, and get paid while you do it.

With Yours, you can share your content in a community of like minded creators, entrepreneurs, writers, and meme engineers — and together unite against censorship, in a decentralized and immutable manner that ensures your voice is heard.

There exists many services today that allow you to create content: Medium, SoundCloud, Wordpress, DeviantArt — just to name a few. But, most, if not all of these major networks, lack one key ingredient; which is the capability for true monetization where you are paid what you deserve.

At Yours, we’re here to change that. We’re going to enable anyone to get paid for the things they create, and allow the world as a whole decide who deserves recognition, fame, and fortune.

We invite you to join us as we create the foundation for the future of content monetization -- and create the best network, with the best content in the world. And, why will it have the best content in the world? Because it's created by YOU, and together we can make it Yours.

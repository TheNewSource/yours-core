Things that have happened since [the last blog
post 9 days ago](/articles/2015-10-14-yc-and-towards-a-prototype-3/):
- **LAUNCH**: I applied to the LAUNCH incubator. As I believe I mentioned on here some time
  ago, I had a great lunch with Jason Calacanis, VC and head of LAUNCH (huge
  thanks to Brian Hoffman of OpenBazaar for connecting us). Jason is awesome -
  it was one of the most interesting and informative lunches of my entire life.
  So I applied to LAUNCH.
- **Transactions**: I updated the transaction builder of fullnode to be [good enough for our
  prototype](https://github.com/ryanxcharles/fullnode/commit/e3b649231e39eade662b313dba619d84e48a6e58).
- **The Name**: Although not something I was planning on doing this week, I have put a great
  deal of effort into the name of our project. Datt is a fine name, but normal
  people don't understand what it means, and I don't own the .com. After I
  researched names and bought a bunch of .coms, I showed them in our Slack and
  asked a few people what they thought.  Unfortunately there was no consensus
  on what a new name should be, so the search for a possible name replacement
  is ongoing for now. Thank to everyone who gave input. I will be revisiting
  this over time. [See the results of some of the names I
  brainstormed](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/blob/b6639b40ef534df943c732ad4c50d5e1cb0c5295/general/names.md).
- **Presentations 1**: Next week I am giving four presentations at Blockchain University Cohort #5
  on things like transactions, blocks, scripts, cryptography, and some BIPs.  I
  will post the slides to dattdocs when they are ready.
- **Presentations 2**: I will also be presenting at the [SF Bitcoin
  Social](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Bitcoin-Social/events/223421691/)
  on Tuesday. I think this will be the first "general audience" presentation of
  Datt.
- **Prototype**: A launch of the prototype is still planned for mid-November. I was hoping to
  have more progress by now on the code, but the past week I've been occupied
  mostly with non-code work. Between my presentations at Blockchain University
  and the SF Bitcoin Social, I will probably not have much time for programming
  next week either. However, I have planned the three weeks after that to be
  dedicated entirely to programming. So it should still be possible to have the
  prototype at a state ready for demoing after that.

There are four pillars of Datt: 1) Technology, 2) Product/Design, 3)
Commmunity, 4) Business. Technology is the hardest problem during the early
days of the project. Until we have a working prototype, it's much harder to
experiment with the product, community, and business, and thus that work is
mostly stuck in the land of theory until we have a prototoype.

Our present goal is to have a working prototype by the (completely arbitrary)
deadline of September 10. I believe we are on track to have a working, albeit
incomplete, prototype by that time. The most important pieces for that to work
are: 1) Willy's excellent database work gets pulled into datt-node, 2) Finish
the EventEmitter interface for basic messages so that it can be integrated into
the UI, 3) Add a simplistic bitcoin wallet for payments, 4) Integrate datt-node
into the UI, 5) Integrate the design work into the UI. Then the prototype will
be complete. It will not be in a state to launch, but the pieces will have been
pulled together in a manner for "internal" demoing (i.e., it will not be ready
for users, but will be ready for us to experiment to make decisions about what
our next steps are).

We are not making active attempts to advertise right now. Although we are
passively advertising, i.e. answering questions about the state of the project
when people inquire, we are not making active steps to broaden awareness of the
project. I believe the launch of the prototype is a good time to take the next
step in advertising our project. We should have a plan around exactly what we
want to do when the prototype is ready. Probably the simplest way to do that is
to leverage social media. I can also write another article about the "launch"
of our prototype, which could either go on Medium or on one of the
bitcoin-related news websites.

I'm continuing with slowly inquiring with individuals working on the project
about what role they might like to play in the company. I haven't gotten around
to contacting everyone yet, so don't feel bad if I haven't contacted you yet (I
know I said this week :) ). It is important that we know who will be a part of
the company when we begin raising money, which will probably be in September.
However, I'm trying to spend as much time as I can building the prototype, so
the process of individually communicating with everyone will still take another
week or two.

I've started working from IDEO as an experimental "Entrepreneur in Residence".
I do not have a formal arrangement with IDEO, however there is a good
possibility we will come up with something. One way this might work is that
IDEO commits to contributing product, design and business work on the project
in exchange for equity. They can also (obviously) provide some office space. I
will update everyone as we work out something more formal. I will also probably
giving a presentation at IDEO about the project in order to find more people at
the company who are interested in helping.

I had the fortune of talking with Jason Calacanis this week, who is a
prospective investor. He is a big figure in the Silicon Valley tech world. He
has a startup incubator, so we will continue to be in touch with him about the
possibility of Datt, Inc. going through that.

I talked with many other people this week, including Juan Benet of ipfs (their
work is very related, but probably too immature to use with our particular app
at this particular time - maybe a few months after our prototype we can try
again to integrate), Matan and Primavera of Backfeed (they have a bunch of
ideas around using smart contracts to completely solve the
economic/social/incentives problems we face, and I will be talking with them
more about that next week), and Tyler Bohlman of Money & Tech (he will probably
want to interview me next week).

Here are some important documents that have been made this week:

- [Ramki's Payment Flow document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B3Y2Y4dTfqZNROoNTGQOzcCSstHEJxnzAJY-Z9fxzcc/edit)
- [Ramki's Business Thoughts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhLrVlBu7_l_xgXkUs9HCWd4nOuh9G4TagO2zjU9Gys/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Paul's Roadmap](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/raw/master/planning/Roadmap%20to%20MVP.png)
- [Darren's sketch of the Datt Network](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattmedia/blob/master/misc/network_overview-01.png)
- [Paul's network graphs](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs/raw/master/UML/Datt%20network%20graph%20circular%20content%20incl%20curation.png)

(Please let me know if I've forgotten something that should be on this list.)

Our prorities in the near-term are:
- Finish a prototype
- Identify who wants to be full-time at the company

Other things that would be nice, but longer-term:
- A blog.
- Payment channels.
- "The Business Plan"
- "The Community Plan"
- "The Product Plan"

How to Contribute to Datt
=========================
Datt is an open-source project, application, protocol, community, and business
that accepts valuable contributions from anyone. Most of our code, documents
and media are in [the main datt repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt)
(probably where you are viewing this document right now), so that is probably
where you will want to make your contribution. Before making a contribution,
you may want to check our [known
issues](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt/issues) to see if someone else is
already working on your issue. If not, fork our repository, make your changes,
and issue a pull request to the appropriate repo. Someone with commit access
(probably Ryan X. Charles) will review your pull request and give feedback, and
accept it if it enhances the project.

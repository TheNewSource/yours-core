How to Contribute to Datt
=========================
Datt is an open-source project, application, protocol, community, and business
that accepts valuable contributions from anyone. If you would like to make a
contribution, first identify which category you could like to contribute to:
- If you want to contribute to the application back-end or front-end, [the main
  datt repo (this one)](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt) is where you want
  to contribute.
- If you want to contribute to business or community plans, those are tracked
  in the [dattdocs repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs).
- If you want to contribute to design, that is tracked in our [dattmedia
  repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattmedia).
- If you want to contribute to the landing page, that is tracked on the
  [datt.co repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt.co).
- If you want to write a blog post, check out our [blog
  repo](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattblog).

Before making a contribution, you may want to check our [known
issues](https://github.com/dattnetwork/datt/issues) to see if someone else is
already working on your issue. If not, fork our repository, make your changes,
and issue a pull request to the appropriate repo. Someone with commit access
will review your pull request and give feedback, and accept it if it enhanes
the project.

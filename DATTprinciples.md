## Principles
**The following principles are essential to DATT:**

 - The network should be uncensorable and users must have final say in content filtering (or the lack of it)
 - Strong anonymity by default, users may optionally assign a stickier identity to themselves via cryptographic signatures
 - We aim for a truly decentralized solution without the need for central servers to hold any content or any registration of users; nor should they be aware of the specific content users are sharing and accessing.
 - Nothing more than a web browser should be required to participate on the network
 - A user should have plausible deniability that they have accepted/stored/consumed/propagated any content item

**Secondary principles that arise from the core principles but are not essential:**

 - Content encryption should be pervasive until a user chooses to decrypt the content
 - Publishers should be incentivised to create quality/popular content
